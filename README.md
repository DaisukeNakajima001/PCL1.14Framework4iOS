# PCL_1.14_Framework_Build_for_iOS
## **Prebuilt iOS Framework for Point Cloud Processing**

âš  **Note:** This build of PCL **excludes any libraries that depend on OpenMP or VTK**.  
PCL modules that require these dependencies have not been built to ensure compatibility with iOS.  
Additionally, I have not personally tested its use as a framework. If it does not work as expected,  
you may need to manually configure **search paths** and **library linking** in Xcode.
